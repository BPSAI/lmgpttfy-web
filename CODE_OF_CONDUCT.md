# Code of Conduct for Let Me GPT That For You (LMGPTTFY)

## Our Pledge
LMGPTTFY is a humorous web tool inspired by "Let Me Google That For You." While the project itself leans into sarcasm and passive-aggressive humor, we pledge to foster a community where contributors and users feel welcome, respected, and safe.

We recognize the difference between lighthearted humor and harmful behavior. This tool should always be used for **gentle humor among friends, colleagues, or communities who appreciate it**—never for harassment, bullying, or cruelty.

## Our Standards

### Positive Behaviors
- Contributing clever, witty, and lighthearted sarcastic messages that make people smile.
- Helping others learn how to ask better AI questions and use tools like ChatGPT effectively.
- Suggesting improvements that maintain the project’s fun and respectful nature.
- Using the tool responsibly, in contexts where humor will be appreciated.
- Respecting international audiences by avoiding culture-specific jokes that could be misinterpreted.

### Unacceptable Behaviors
- Submitting sarcastic content that includes slurs, excessive profanity, personal attacks, or cruel language.
- Using the tool to harass, demean, or cyberbully individuals or groups.
- Targeting people based on protected characteristics (e.g., race, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation).
- Promoting or enabling malicious uses of the tool.
- Contributing code that could track, exploit, or harm users.

## Humor Guidelines for Sarcastic Content
- **Do:** Keep it lighthearted, witty, and workplace-appropriate.
- **Do:** Focus humor on the *situation* (someone asking an obvious AI question), not the *person*.
- **Do Not:** Submit content that punches down or humiliates.
- **Do Not:** Use discriminatory, cruel, or profane language.

### Examples
- ✅ Good sarcastic message: *"I've done the hard part for you... All you need to do is press: ENTER."*
- ❌ Bad sarcastic message: *Any message containing profanity, personal insults, or targeting protected groups.*
